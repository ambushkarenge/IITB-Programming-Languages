# CS 302/316 (Spring 2019) - IIT Bombay

***[ Please find the commit history for various assignments in their respective branches. ]***

This project implements a subset of C language defined in at [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/sclp-web/] called _sclp_.

- The code involves a scanner, parser and a semantic analyzer to translate code in a C-like language that supports functionalities like arithmetic expressions, control flow statements and function calls into MIPS assembly code.
- The code implements constructs like Symbol Tables, Abstract Syntax Trees and Intermediate Code Statements.


It was developed during my study of the CS 302/316 - **Implementation of Programming Languages & Lab** course in Spring 2019 at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India.
