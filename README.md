# CS 302/316 (Spring 2019) - IIT Bombay

> This project implements a subset of C language defined in at [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/sclp-web/] called _sclp_.

It was developed during my study of the CS 302/316 - **Implementation of Programming Languages & Lab** course in Spring 2019 at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India.

- The code involves a **_scanner_**, **_parser_** and a **_semantic analyzer_** to translate code in a C-like language that supports functionalities like **_arithmetic expressions_**, **_control flow statements_** and **_function calls_** into MIPS assembly code.
- The code implements constructs like **_Symbol Tables_**, **_Abstract Syntax Trees_** and **_Intermediate Code Statements_**.
